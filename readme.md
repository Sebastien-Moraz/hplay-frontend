    * [How to use your workflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

    * Propose a new feature in [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/CPNV-ES/projects/27/views/9) as backlog
        * We only use technical stories
    * Pull requests are open to merge in the develop branch.
    * Release on the main branch we use GitFlow and not with GitHub release.
    * Issues are added to the [github issues page](https://github.com/JuilletMikael/RIA-EggFlix/issues)

  If needed to create a feature based on a feature you can do it with git flow like this.

  ````bash
  git flow feature start new-feature feature/based-feature
  ````
  And to finish it :
  ````bash
  git flow feature finish new-feature
  ````
